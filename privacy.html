    <h1>Privacy Policy for BallMazeEscape</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 25, 2024</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in the BallMazeEscape mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information from you. The App uses the device's sensors and local storage for its core functionality, but this data is not collected or transmitted by us.</p>
    <p>Specifically, the App uses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Sensors (Accelerometer/Gyroscope):</strong> The App uses the device's motion sensors to control the movement of the ball within the maze. This data is processed in real-time on your device and is not stored, collected, or transmitted to us or any third party.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> The App may use your device's local storage (<code>AsyncStorage</code>) to save game progress, high scores, or settings. This data is stored only on your device and is not accessible to us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The data accessed by the App is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the core gameplay functionality (controlling the ball).</li>
        <li>To save and retrieve your game state locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use this information for any other purpose, such as advertising or analytics.</p>

    <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personal information, and therefore we do not share any information with third parties. All data used by the App remains on your device.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Data stored locally on your device (like game saves) will remain on your device until you clear the app data or uninstall the App. We do not have access to this data and cannot delete it for you.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. Since we do not collect or store your personal information on our servers, the security of the data depends on the security of your own device.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is a simple game suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from children without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our app store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
